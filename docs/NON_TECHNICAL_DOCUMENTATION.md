# OutfitFlex - Non-Technical Documentation

## What is OutfitFlex?

OutfitFlex is a smart fashion companion app that helps you organize your wardrobe, create stylish outfits, and get personalized fashion recommendations. Think of it as your personal stylist that lives in your phone!

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### The Magic Behind the App

**Your Digital Wardrobe:**
Imagine having a photo album of all your clothes, but smarter! You take pictures of your clothing items, and the app automatically organizes them by color, type (shirts, pants, shoes), and season. It's like having a super-organized closet that never gets messy.

**Smart Outfit Suggestions:**
The app uses artificial intelligence (AI) - think of it as a really smart computer brain that has studied thousands of fashion combinations. It looks at your clothes, considers the weather, your plans for the day, and suggests outfits that look great together.

**Weather-Aware Fashion:**
The app checks the weather in your area and suggests appropriate outfits. No more wearing a heavy coat on a sunny day or getting caught in the rain with inappropriate clothes!
